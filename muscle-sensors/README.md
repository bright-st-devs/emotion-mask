# Muscle Sensors

This code runs on an Arduino Uno and shows a smile on an [LED Matrix](https://www.creatroninc.com/product/16x16-led-matrix-board/). When you flex your muscle the LED shows a smile and when you are not flexing it is empty.

This code was inspired by sample code found [here](https://www.creatroninc.com/download/16x16-LED-Matrix-Board-Demo-Code.zip).

## Wiring Diagram

To use this code wire your LED matrix and Arduino as follows.
