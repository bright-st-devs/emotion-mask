# Microphone

This code runs on an Arduino Uno and displays a smile when you speak in a quiteter voice. If you in a louder voice it will show a frown. This is displayed on an [LED Matrix](https://www.creatroninc.com/product/16x16-led-matrix-board/). I have not used the word smile or frown because word recognization is to hard and would be difficult to achive in this amount of time.

This code was inspired by sample code found [here](https://www.creatroninc.com/download/16x16-LED-Matrix-Board-Demo-Code.zip).

## Wiring Diagram

To use this code wire your LED matrix and Arduino as follows.
