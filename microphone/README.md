This code runs on an Arduino Uno and displays a smile when you speak between 10 and 20 delta. If you go over 20 delta it will show a frown. This is displayed on an [LED Matrix](https://www.creatroninc.com/product/16x16-led-matrix-board/).

This code was inspired by sample code found [here](https://www.creatroninc.com/download/16x16-LED-Matrix-Board-Demo-Code.zip).
